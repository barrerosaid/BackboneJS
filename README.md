Training with BackboneJS

# Notes for Training:
* BackboneJS is a structured MVC JavaScript library
 * Models: Contains application data. This stores the data
 * Views: Display data on the screen. This displays the model onto a webpage
 * Controllers: Transfers the model data to the view. These are a group of models similar to a JavaScript array
* Backbone Components
 * Events: used to bind custom events in our code such as mouseclicks and mouseover
 * Routers: create navigation in our web app (similar to controllers in MVC)
 * Sync: maps Backbone data to the server side such as databases
* Backbone Facts:
 * Components are JavaScript objects
  * Built as a list of key/vaile pairs from JavaScript methods and properties
  * Methods can be custom built
 * Typiscally used to build single-page applications (SPAs)
 * Backbone is not a framework since it doesn't need configuration while a library has prebuilt functions ready to use
